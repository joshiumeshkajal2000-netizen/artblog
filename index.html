      <h2>I Didn’t Know I Was Becoming Confident</h2>
      <time datetime="2026-2-7">Feburary 7, 2026</time>
      <p>
        For a long time, confidence felt like something I didn’t have.
        I labelled myself early on—quiet, introverted, someone who stayed in the background. I believed I wasn’t good at talking to new people, let alone standing in front of a room full of them. The idea of leading, teaching, or being looked at felt intimidating.
        <br><br>
        Confidence, I thought, belonged to other people.
        <br><br>
        And yet, life has a strange way of nudging you exactly where you need to go—sometimes without asking.
        <br><br>
        Through what I can only describe as a stroke of luck mixed with a series of impulsive decisions, I found myself making a simple enquiry. Nothing dramatic. Just curiosity. Just a “what if?”
        That enquiry led me to work as a freelance artist with a company that conducted paint parties.
        <br><br>
        At the time, I didn’t see it as a big deal.
        It wasn’t a long-term plan. It wasn’t strategic. It was just something I agreed to try.
        <br><br>
        What I didn’t realise then was how much that decision would shape me.
        <br><br>
        Suddenly, I was standing in front of groups of people—strangers—guiding them step by step through a painting. Managing a room. Explaining. Encouraging. Holding attention. Answering questions on the spot. Dealing with nerves, unpredictability, and self-doubt in real time.
        <br><br>
        None of it came naturally.
        <br><br>
        I remember being anxious before sessions. Questioning whether I was “good enough” to be teaching. Worrying about being judged. But I showed up anyway. And then again. And again.
        <br><br>
        Slowly, something shifted.
        <br><br>
        I learned how to speak clearly and with intent.
        How to project my voice.
        How to take control of a space without being loud.
        How to read the room, manage time, and adapt when things didn’t go as planned.
        <br><br>
        Without realising it, I was building confidence—not the loud, performative kind, but a quieter, steadier one. The kind that comes from doing the thing you’re afraid of and surviving it. Repeatedly.
        <br><br>
        Fast forward to now, I’m no longer in that industry at all. That chapter has closed. I’ve moved on, pursued other paths, and today I’m studying for an MBA in finance—something that looks, on the surface, completely unrelated to where I started.
        <br><br>
        But when I look back, I see it clearly.
        <br><br>
        The way I speak during presentations.
        The comfort I feel addressing a room.
        The ability to represent ideas, communicate clearly, and hold my ground.
        All the soft skills that are expected of an MBA student—confidence, articulation, presence.
        <br><br>
        They didn’t come out of nowhere.
        <br><br>
        They were built quietly, over time, in art studios and party halls, holding paintbrushes instead of presentations. In spaces I never expected would teach me how to lead.
        <br><br>
        I didn’t become confident by deciding to be confident.
        I became confident by saying yes before I felt ready.
        <br><br>
        And only in retrospect do I realise how important that phase was—how deeply it shaped the person I am today. How art, even when it wasn’t the final destination, became a bridge.
        <br><br>
        A bridge from who I thought I was, to who I was becoming.

      <h2>Making Peace with “Just a Hobby”</h2>
      <time datetime="2026-1-31">January 31, 2026</time>
      <p>
        Sometimes, you don’t stop making art because you stopped caring.You stop because life gets louder.
        <br><br>
        Work takes over. Responsibilities pile up. Energy runs thin. And slowly, the thing that once felt like refuge begins to feel overwhelming. Where to start? What to make? Will it be any good? The blank page starts asking questions you don’t have answers for anymore.
        <br><br>
        I hadn’t sketched in months.
        I convinced myself that art had taken a backseat in my life—that maybe I’d outgrown it, or that it no longer fit into who I was becoming. And honestly, that thought hurt more than I admitted.
        <br><br>
        Then, in a completely ordinary moment—a random conversation with a friend—something shifted. A small spark. Not enough to dive back in headfirst, but enough to look again.
        <br><br>
        I found myself reaching for a medium I hadn’t touched in years. One of the very first I’d ever tried. Oil pastels.
        <br><br>
        I didn’t start with a grand idea. I scrolled through Pinterest, picked a reference, and reminded myself—over and over—that I didn’t have to create something new. I wasn’t selling it. I wasn’t proving anything. I was allowed to recreate. To borrow. To take the pressure off.
        <br><br>
        And something beautiful happened.
        <br><br>
        I made one piece. Then another. Then another.
        I felt relaxed. Grounded. Lighter.
        It was like my hands remembered before my mind could interfere.
        <br><br>
        That process reminded me of something important:
        my skills hadn’t disappeared.
        They were just quiet. Waiting.
        <br><br>
        As I grow—in life, in career, in responsibilities—art may not always be my priority. And that’s okay. It doesn’t need to compete for attention. It doesn’t need a label bigger than it can hold right now.
        <br><br>
        Art is my home.
        A place I can return to when I’m ready.
        A refuge, not a demand.
        <br><br>
        Breaks are allowed.
        Letting go is allowed.
        Calling it a hobby is allowed.
        <br><br>
        It can be more someday. But if right now it’s just something that helps me breathe again—that is more than enough.
        <br><br>
        And if you’ve stepped away too, maybe this is your reminder:
        you’re not gone. You’re just paused.
        <br><br>
        And you can come back, gently.</p>

      <h2>An Accidental Love Affair With Clay</h2>
      <time datetime="2026-1-10">January 10, 2026</time>
      <p>
        I didn’t start working with clay because I planned to. I started because my work forced me to.
        <br><br>
        At the time, I had to explore air-dry clay as a medium, and I remember approaching it with hesitation. It felt unfamiliar. Messy. A little out of my comfort zone. But once I started, something clicked.
        <br><br>
        I found myself making ice cream waffle cones — bigger than life.
Oversized. Textured. Detailed. I painted them carefully, trying to make them look as real as possible. And somewhere in that process — shaping, painting, refining — I realised I was enjoying it. Really enjoying it. The hands-on nature of it. The patience it required. The slow transformation from raw clay to something tangible.
        <br><br>
        That experience opened a door.
        <br><br>
        Once I got comfortable with clay, curiosity took over. I began experimenting on my own terms — and almost instinctively, the scale shifted, I gravitated back to what I’ve always loved—small scale. Miniatures. Objects that fit in the palm of your hand and invite you to look closer. Clay became just another way to explore that obsession.
        <br><br>
        That’s when the ghost appeared.
        <br><br>
        A tiny ghost character — simple, expressive, and oddly comforting. It slowly became my mascot of sorts. I started personalising it, giving it little stories through objects and gestures. A ghost holding a shawarma. A ghost with a backpack and a map, clearly in travel mode. A ghost sitting quietly with glasses on, reading a book — one for all the book lovers who see themselves in moments like that.
        <br><br>
        Each ghost felt like a personality. A version of someone. Sometimes, a version of me.
        <br><br>
        Eventually, I began customising these miniature ghosts for clients — tailoring them to their interests, habits, and stories. What started as an experiment became something deeply personal, not just for me, but for the people receiving them. They stopped being just objects and became small reflections of someone’s world.
        <br><br>
        Then came another first.
        <br><br>
        My first-ever pop-up stall.
        <br><br>
        I didn’t go into it with expectations. I just wanted to experience what it felt like to put my work out there — physically, publicly, in a space where people could hold it, react to it, choose it. I sold miniature ghost keychains that day, and every sale felt surreal. Watching strangers connect with something I had made with my hands was both nerve-wracking and validating in the quietest way.
        <br><br>
        Looking back, that entire journey — from oversized waffle cones to tiny ghost keychains — taught me something important: not all creative paths begin with intention. Some begin with obligation. Some with curiosity. Some by accident.
        <br><br>
        And sometimes, the smallest things end up carrying the most meaning and stay with us the longest.

      <h2>My Obsession With Miniatures</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-12-20">December 20, 2025</time>
      <p>I’ve always gravitated toward small things. Not just physically small, but quietly meaningful. The kind that don’t demand attention, but reward it if you choose to linger.
        <br><br>
        Sketching small feels natural to me. These tiny pieces of paper — barely 3.5 cm by 2.5 cm — don’t intimidate me the way larger pages do. They feel manageable, almost forgiving. There’s no pressure to fill space or make a statement. All they ask is that I pay attention.
        <br><br>
        Working at this scale forces me to slow down. Every line becomes intentional. There’s no room for excess, no space to overthink. The focus it takes is almost meditative. I find myself noticing details I would otherwise overlook — subtle textures, quiet shapes, fragments of memory that surface when I stop rushing.
        <br><br>
        On these miniature pages, I don’t try to recreate entire scenes. I sketch memories. Something small that reminds me of what happened that day — a detail, an object, a moment. A visual cue. Like a souvenir from that day, but one that holds feeling instead of facts.
        <br><br>
        What I love about this process is that it mirrors how memory actually works. We don’t remember everything. We remember pieces. The way something made us feel. The smallest things that somehow stay with us long after everything else fades.
        <br><br>
        These tiny sketches aren’t meant to be impressive or complete. They’re personal. Intimate. Meant for slow looking. Sometimes, they make sense only to me — and that’s enough.
        <br><br>
        In a world that constantly pushes for bigger, faster, louder, I keep returning to the small. Because small allows me to stay present. To notice. To remember.
        <br><br>
        And in these miniature spaces, I’ve found a way to carry moments with me — quietly, gently, one tiny page at a time.

      <h2>Art as a Way of Being Present</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-12-06">December 6, 2025</time>
      <p>Lately, I’ve realised how rarely I actually pause.
         Even when I’m resting, my mind keeps running—thinking ahead, replaying things, worrying about what’s next.

        <br><br>
        Art didn’t fix that.
        But it gave me a place to stop.

        <br><br>
        When I draw, I slow down without trying to. I start noticing things I’d normally rush past—the way light falls on a surface, the quiet of a moment, the feeling sitting in my chest that I hadn’t named yet. The act of drawing keeps me there. Present. Looking a little longer than usual.

        <br><br>
        Some pages in my sketchbook don’t have a clear intention. I just sit, make marks, repeat a line, follow a thought. And somewhere in that process, I start to feel again—not in a dramatic way, just honestly. Calmly. Without needing to explain anything.
        <br><br>
        In Passing became that space for me. A place where moments don’t need to be important to be noticed. Where feelings don’t need clarity to exist. Where I can stay with something for a while, instead of moving on too quickly.
        <br><br>
        Art taught me that presence isn’t about doing nothing.
        It’s about being where you are—fully, even if only for a few minutes.
        <br><br>
        And sometimes, that’s enough to make everything feel a little lighter.

      <h2>My Favourite Art Supplies — And Why I Swear by the Simple Ones</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-11-08">November 8, 2025</time>
      <p>When I started In Passing, I didn’t set out to make it look a certain way.
        I didn’t have fancy tools or an aesthetic setup — just what I already owned: a small sketchbook, a couple of pens, and some time in between everything else.
        <br><br>
        Somehow, that simplicity stuck.
        <br><br>
        My go-to tools are incredibly basic — a fine liner, a black pen, and sometimes a brush pen for deeper strokes. The paper isn’t premium either; it’s just good enough to hold the ink. And maybe that’s what makes it work.
        <br><br>
        Using simple materials keeps me grounded. There’s no pressure to “make it perfect” because there’s nothing extravagant at stake. It’s just me, my sketchbook, and a few lines that turn into thoughts. The limitation actually gives me freedom — to experiment, to mess up, to draw without the fear of wasting anything.
        <br><br>
        I’ve realized that creativity doesn’t always come from what you have — it often grows from what you make do with.
        That’s why I stick to the basics. They remind me that art isn’t about tools; it’s about intention.
        <br><br>
        For me, simplicity is not a compromise — it’s a choice.
        Because when the materials are minimal, the emotion gets to take centre stage.
        <br><br>
        And that’s exactly what In Passing is about — finding meaning in the little things, one line at a time.</p>

      <img src="images\thejoyandpressureofsharingmyworkpublically.jpeg" alt="The Joy and Pressure of Sharing My Work" />
      <h2>The Joy and Pressure of Sharing My Work</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-11-01">November 1, 2025</time>
      <p>There’s a strange duality that comes with sharing your art.
        On one hand, there’s joy — that quiet thrill of knowing something you created might resonate with someone else.
        On the other, there’s pressure — the fear of being seen too closely, of your imperfections becoming public.
        <br><br>
        When I first decided to start posting my sketches from In Passing, it wasn’t easy. For years, my art lived quietly inside closed sketchbooks — safe, unseen, and protected from judgment. There was comfort in that privacy. If no one saw it, no one could misunderstand it.
        <br><br>
        But art, I’ve come to realize, isn’t meant to exist in isolation.
        There’s something powerful about letting it breathe — about giving it space to connect with others. Even if it’s uncomfortable. Even if it feels like standing under a spotlight when you’d rather stay in the wings.
        <br><br>
        Sharing my work publicly has taught me two things:
        One — joy doesn’t come from validation; it comes from connection.
        When someone messages me saying a piece reminded them of a memory or a feeling, I’m reminded that art is a language — and sometimes, it speaks for us when we can’t find the words.
        <br><br>
        And two — the pressure never fully disappears, but it changes.
        It shifts from “Will they like this?” to “Am I being honest?”
        That’s the kind of pressure I can live with — the kind that pushes me to stay authentic instead of perfect.
        <br><br>
        Putting In Passing out into the world still makes me nervous. But it also makes me grateful — that something so personal can travel beyond me and find meaning elsewhere.
        Because at the end of the day, that’s what art is: an offering. Not of perfection, but of presence.</p>

      <h2>Finding Inspiration in Everyday Life</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-10-25">October 25, 2025</time>
      <p>We often imagine inspiration as something rare — a sudden flash of brilliance, a perfect moment, or a grand idea waiting to strike. But more often than not, it’s hiding in plain sight — in the quiet rhythm of our days, in the way light hits a wall, or in the small pauses between things.
        <br><br>
        When I started my series “In Passing,” I wasn’t searching for meaning. I was simply trying to draw again — without pressure, without needing every page to be good. What I discovered along the way was that inspiration doesn’t always arrive fully formed. Sometimes it’s just… a glimpse.
        <br><br>
        A colour that reminds you of a memory.<br>
        A conversation overheard in passing.<br>
        A crack in the wall that somehow mirrors the feeling you can’t put into words.
        <br><br>
        These moments — the ones we often overlook — have their own quiet beauty. They ask nothing from us except to notice.
        <br><br>
        Inspiration, I’ve learned, isn’t about chasing what’s extraordinary. It’s about paying attention to what already exists — the mundane, the fleeting, the familiar. The morning coffee that feels a little warmer today. The way the world slows down when it rains. The empty chair across from you.
        <br><br>
        Everyday life offers us infinite stories, emotions, and metaphors — if we allow ourselves to see them.
        And maybe that’s what art really is: the practice of noticing.
        <br><br>
        So the next time you feel uninspired, don’t wait for something big to happen. Look around. Breathe. Watch how light shifts through the window. Listen to your own thoughts settle.
        Because sometimes, the most powerful ideas arrive quietly — in passing.</p>

      <h2>What Art means to me</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-10-18">October 18, 2025</time>
      <p>For the longest time, I thought art had to mean something grand.
        It had to be perfect, polished, and ready to impress.
        But over the years, I’ve realized that art isn’t about presentation — it’s about presence.
        <br><br>
        To me, art is a quiet conversation with myself.
        It’s where I process the things I don’t always have words for — a fleeting memory, a passing feeling, a moment that deserves to be seen before it disappears.
        It’s not about creating something extraordinary, but about noticing the ordinary a little more deeply.
        <br><br>
        My creative philosophy is simple:
        Show up honestly, not perfectly.
        Some days that means a finished sketch. Other days, just a few uneven lines or unfinished thoughts. Both matter.
        Because art, at its core, is not about performance — it’s about permission. The permission to explore, to feel, to exist without judgment.
        <br><br>
        That’s how In Passing began — as a space to slow down, observe, and make peace with imperfection.
        Each page is a small reminder that creativity doesn’t always need clarity. Sometimes, it just needs you to show up.
