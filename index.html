      <h2>What Art means to me</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-10-18">October 18, 2025</time>
      <p>For the longest time, I thought art had to mean something grand.
        It had to be perfect, polished, and ready to impress.
        But over the years, I’ve realized that art isn’t about presentation — it’s about presence.
        <br><br>
        To me, art is a quiet conversation with myself.
        It’s where I process the things I don’t always have words for — a fleeting memory, a passing feeling, a moment that deserves to be seen before it disappears.
        It’s not about creating something extraordinary, but about noticing the ordinary a little more deeply.
        <br><br>
        My creative philosophy is simple:
        Show up honestly, not perfectly.
        Some days that means a finished sketch. Other days, just a few uneven lines or unfinished thoughts. Both matter.
        Because art, at its core, is not about performance — it’s about permission. The permission to explore, to feel, to exist without judgment.
        <br><br>
        That’s how In Passing began — as a space to slow down, observe, and make peace with imperfection.
        Each page is a small reminder that creativity doesn’t always need clarity. Sometimes, it just needs you to show up.
        <br><br>
        Art, for me, is not a product. It’s a process — one that mirrors life itself: imperfect, evolving, and beautifully human.</p>

      <h2>Finding Inspiration in Everyday Life</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-10-25">October 25, 2025</time>
      <p>We often imagine inspiration as something rare — a sudden flash of brilliance, a perfect moment, or a grand idea waiting to strike. But more often than not, it’s hiding in plain sight — in the quiet rhythm of our days, in the way light hits a wall, or in the small pauses between things.
        <br><br>
        When I started my series “In Passing,” I wasn’t searching for meaning. I was simply trying to draw again — without pressure, without needing every page to be good. What I discovered along the way was that inspiration doesn’t always arrive fully formed. Sometimes it’s just… a glimpse.
        <br><br>
        A colour that reminds you of a memory.<br>
        A conversation overheard in passing.<br>
        A crack in the wall that somehow mirrors the feeling you can’t put into words.
        <br><br>
        These moments — the ones we often overlook — have their own quiet beauty. They ask nothing from us except to notice.
        <br><br>
        Inspiration, I’ve learned, isn’t about chasing what’s extraordinary. It’s about paying attention to what already exists — the mundane, the fleeting, the familiar. The morning coffee that feels a little warmer today. The way the world slows down when it rains. The empty chair across from you.
        <br><br>
        Everyday life offers us infinite stories, emotions, and metaphors — if we allow ourselves to see them.
        And maybe that’s what art really is: the practice of noticing.
        <br><br>
        So the next time you feel uninspired, don’t wait for something big to happen. Look around. Breathe. Watch how light shifts through the window. Listen to your own thoughts settle.
        Because sometimes, the most powerful ideas arrive quietly — in passing.</p>

      <h2>The Joy and Pressure of Sharing My Work</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-11-01">November 1, 2025</time>
      <p>There’s a strange duality that comes with sharing your art.
        On one hand, there’s joy — that quiet thrill of knowing something you created might resonate with someone else.
        On the other, there’s pressure — the fear of being seen too closely, of your imperfections becoming public.
        <br><br>
        When I first decided to start posting my sketches from In Passing, it wasn’t easy. For years, my art lived quietly inside closed sketchbooks — safe, unseen, and protected from judgment. There was comfort in that privacy. If no one saw it, no one could misunderstand it.
        <br><br>
        But art, I’ve come to realize, isn’t meant to exist in isolation.
        There’s something powerful about letting it breathe — about giving it space to connect with others. Even if it’s uncomfortable. Even if it feels like standing under a spotlight when you’d rather stay in the wings.
        <br><br>
        Sharing my work publicly has taught me two things:
        One — joy doesn’t come from validation; it comes from connection.
        When someone messages me saying a piece reminded them of a memory or a feeling, I’m reminded that art is a language — and sometimes, it speaks for us when we can’t find the words.
        <br><br>
        And two — the pressure never fully disappears, but it changes.
        It shifts from “Will they like this?” to “Am I being honest?”
        That’s the kind of pressure I can live with — the kind that pushes me to stay authentic instead of perfect.
        <br><br>
        Putting In Passing out into the world still makes me nervous. But it also makes me grateful — that something so personal can travel beyond me and find meaning elsewhere.
        Because at the end of the day, that’s what art is: an offering. Not of perfection, but of presence.</p>

      <h2>My Favourite Art Supplies — And Why I Swear by the Simple Ones</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-11-08">November 8, 2025</time>
      <p>When I started In Passing, I didn’t set out to make it look a certain way.
        I didn’t have fancy tools or an aesthetic setup — just what I already owned: a small sketchbook, a couple of pens, and some time in between everything else.
        <br><br>
        Somehow, that simplicity stuck.
        <br><br>
        My go-to tools are incredibly basic — a fine liner, a black pen, and sometimes a brush pen for deeper strokes. The paper isn’t premium either; it’s just good enough to hold the ink. And maybe that’s what makes it work.
        <br><br>
        Using simple materials keeps me grounded. There’s no pressure to “make it perfect” because there’s nothing extravagant at stake. It’s just me, my sketchbook, and a few lines that turn into thoughts. The limitation actually gives me freedom — to experiment, to mess up, to draw without the fear of wasting anything.
        <br><br>
        I’ve realized that creativity doesn’t always come from what you have — it often grows from what you make do with.
        That’s why I stick to the basics. They remind me that art isn’t about tools; it’s about intention.
        <br><br>
        For me, simplicity is not a compromise — it’s a choice.
        Because when the materials are minimal, the emotion gets to take centre stage.
        <br><br>
        And that’s exactly what In Passing is about — finding meaning in the little things, one line at a time.</p>
